# Hello! 👋🏽

I'm Ekene Eze, Kenny for short.
I'm a Software Engineer and Developer Advocate at [Shardeum](https://shardeum.org/)
In the past, I've worked with companies like:

* [Netlify](https://netlify.com/us)
* [Flutterwave](https://flutterwave.com/us)
* [Collab.Land](collab.land)

I founded [DXmentorship program](https://www.dxmentorship.com) to help more developers upskill in developer relations.
You'll mostly find projects I built while teaching via my blog posts and video tutorials on my Github and a couple OSS projects I maintain. 
If you'd like to say hi, I'm available on socials
