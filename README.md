# Hello! 👋🏽

I'm Ekene Eze, but you can call me Kenny. I like to learn A LOT! So you'll mostly find me talking about the things I've learnt and the things I'm doing with that knowledge.

I'm mostly interested in the Jamstack and Vuejs so you might also find me writing, making video courses, YouTube tutorials, and and general sharing my thoughts on what the said topics.

I work as a Developer Experience Engineer at [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) - A company that makes it quick and straightforward for developers and enterprises to build and deploy web applications and websites.

You'll mostly find demos that I've built while teaching via my blog posts and video tutorials on this repository. If you'd like to say hi, I'm available on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kenny_io) `@kenny_io`.

Oh and when I'm not working, I like playing video games, hanging out with friends, and making people laugh
