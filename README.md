# Hello! üëãüèΩ

I'm Ekene Eze, Kenny for short.

I'm a Software Engineer and Developer Advocate with over 5 years experience working in DevRel across different functions. 

In the past I've worked with companies like:

* [Netlify](https://netlify.com/us)
* [Flutterwave](https://flutterwave.com/us)
* [Plasmic](https://plasmic.app)
* [Collab.Land](collab.land)

I founded [DXmentorship program](https://www.dxmentorship.com) to help more developers upskill in developer relations.

You'll mostly find demos that I've built while teaching via my blog posts and video tutorials on my Github and some OSS projects I'm maintaining. 

If you'd like to say hi, I'm available on socials
