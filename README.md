# Hello! üëãüèΩ

I'm Ekene Eze, but you can call me Kenny. I like to learn A LOT! So you'll mostly find me talking about the things I've learnt and the things I'm doing with that knowledge.

I'm mostly interested in the Jamstack, Vuejs and all things JavaScript so you might also find me writing, making video courses, YouTube tutorials, and generally sharing my thoughts on the said topics. Most recently I've been diving into the no-code/low-code space and learning visual building.

I currently work as the Director of Developer Experience at [Plasmic](https://plasmic.app/) - A company that helps developers, designers, and content managers create stunning websites and applications without code.

You'll mostly find demos that I've built while teaching via my blog posts and video tutorials on this repository. If you'd like to say hi, I'm available on [Twitter - @kenny_io](https://twitter.com/kenny_io) 

Oh and when I'm not working, I like playing video games, hanging out with friends, and making people laugh! If you want to learn more about me, consider checking out more of my social links:
